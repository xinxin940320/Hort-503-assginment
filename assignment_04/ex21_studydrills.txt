Let's do some math interesting!
Doing math the easy way: 2+8.
Doing math the hard way: 2*10!
Doing math the hard way: 20*8!
I can calculate by hand, and the result is 160!

def add(c,d):
    print(f"Doing math the easy way: {c}+{d}.")
    return c+d
def multiply(e,f):
    print(f"Doing math the hard way: {e}*{f}!")
    return e*f
c = 2
